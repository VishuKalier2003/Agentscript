// The security taxonomy shared by events, metrics, findings, and the dashboard. The vocabularies
// are deliberately separate: an authority decision (what Crane allowed), an execution outcome
// (what happened), a security assessment (whether it complied), an enforcement outcome (how the
// control performed), and a telemetry status (how the fact is known). A denied attack is never a
// breach, a missing measurement is never zero, and absence of evidence is never evidence of absence.
