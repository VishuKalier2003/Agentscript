// .crane/context.json: policy context bindings. A text file bound to a policy is supplied to the
// agent with that policy when a session starts. Context is guidance, never authorization: it
// cannot relax a policy, and the hook decides independently of it. The digest of each bound file
// is recorded, so a context file changed after binding is reported as stale.
