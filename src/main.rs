// Layers, from the bottom: platform (Git, files, time) -> trust (keys, digests, signatures,
// rollback anchors) -> selection (anchors, signed registry, location tracker) -> governance
// (checkpoints, policies, configuration, verification) -> hooks (agent adapters and runtime
// enforcement) -> telemetry (identity, events, metrics, autonomy ledger, compliance) -> foxx
// (read-only dashboard) and integrations; cli dispatches the commands.

    - None (arguments are read from the process environment)
 * Output
    - None
